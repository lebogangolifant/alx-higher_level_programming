# Project: Python Programming

This project focuses on the basics of Python programming. It covers various concepts and resources to get started with Python.

## Concepts

The main concept covered in this project is:

- __Python programming__

## Resources

- [The Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
- [Pycodestyle – Style Guide for Python Code](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/)

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Editors: [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [vi, vim](https://www.vim.org/)
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `python3` (version `3.8.5`)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.\*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

### Shell Scripts

- Editors: [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [vi, vim](https://www.vim.org/)
- All your scripts will be tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
- All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`wc -l file` should print 2)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
- All your files must be executable

### C Scripts

- Editors: [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [vi, vim](https://www.vim.org/)
- All your files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using` `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `lists.h`
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded

### Pycodestyle

`Pycodestyle` is now the [new standard of Python style code](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/466).
